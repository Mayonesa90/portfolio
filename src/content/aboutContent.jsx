        Hi, I’m a frontend developer passionate about creating intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible web experiences. I specialize in React and TypeScript, crafting solutions like planners, booking systems, and e-commerce features that solve real problems and make life easier for users. Accessibility is a core focus of my work. Growing up with an older brother who has Down syndrome has given me a deep understanding of the importance of designing for everyone, especially those who can’t always advocate for themselves.

        Beyond technical skills, I bring strong communication, organization, and adaptability to every project. As a single mom, I’ve mastered multitasking and staying efficient, which helps me deliver high-quality results even in dynamic environments. I love collaborating with teams to turn ideas into meaningful, impactful applications.
        <br />

        If you’re looking for a developer who combines technical expertise with a commitment to inclusion and thoughtful design, I’d love to connect!
